WorknHire

A decentralized escrow marketplace built on Algorand blockchain that ensures secure, transparent, and trustless transactions between freelancers and clients. This eliminates payment fraud, unpaid work, and trust issues by leveraging smart contracts for automated fund release based on milestone completion.

ðŸŒŸ Why AlgoEscrow?
Traditional freelance platforms suffer from:

Payment Fraud: Clients disappearing after work completion

Unpaid Work: Freelancers working without payment guarantees

High Fees: Centralized platforms charging 10-20% commissions

Lack of Trust: No transparent escrow mechanism

Delayed Payments: Manual approval processes taking days

AlgoEscrow solves these problems with blockchain-powered escrow that automatically releases funds when conditions are met, providing security for both parties.
